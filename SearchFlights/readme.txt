Searchflights.java by Michael Wong

Takes in two inputs as well as three input data files. 
Program finds entries corresponding to input arrival and departure locations using a 
tree set implementation to sort and remove duplicate entries.

Compile then run in commandline: 
1. javac searchFlights.java
2. java searchFlights -o YYZ -d YYC

The three text files: Provider1.txt, Provider2.txt and Provider3.txt 
have to be in the same directory as the class file after compilation.
